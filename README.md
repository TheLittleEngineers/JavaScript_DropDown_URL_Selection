This code resides at: "http://www.TheLittleEngineers.org/files/js/dropdown.js". This code was originally written in 1996 as part of the
Binary Systems of Alabama Website. The code remained "lost" for a couple of decades, until found on an old 20MB Seagate MFM hard drive
that had been used with a Tandy Radio Shack TRS-80 Color Computer 3 and the Burke & Burke CoCo XT-RTC interface. Back then, I used the
Color Computer 3 and Telewriter-128 to code my webpages, mainly for the sake of nostalgia. I then transferred them via RS232 serial with
a null modem cable to my WinTel machine for further processing.
